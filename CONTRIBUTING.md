# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to WhatsappWebBot.

WhatsappWebBot is an open source project and we would love to receive contributions from you!

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into WhatsappWebBot itself.

# Ground Rules

Responsibilities
* Ensure that code is formatted with black, passes mypy non strict check and passes bandit check; to be sure just run the check.sh in the pipenv environment
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/RikyIsola/WhatsappWebBot/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to WhatsappWebBot?

You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

## Working on your first Pull Request?
You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request)

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help

# Getting started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. If you have not done it yet, intall [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
3. Do the changes in your fork
4. Use black to format the code
5. Run the check.sh file in the pipenv environment to verify your work
6. If you like the change and think the project could use it send a pull request

# How to report a bug

## Security disclosure

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Follow the steps described in the [security policy](https://github.com/RikyIsola/WhatsappWebBot/blob/main/SECURITY.md)

## Bug report

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What did you do?
2. What did you expect to see?
3. What did you see instead?
4. Include the logs

When you fill a new bug issue use the bug report template

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in WhatsappWebBot, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list using the Feature request and describe the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code, commit message and labeling conventions

The code should be formatted with [black](https://github.com/psf/black)

The commit message should respect the [Emoji-Log](https://github.com/ahmadawais/Emoji-Log) commit message convention

The labeling convention is the standard Github one
