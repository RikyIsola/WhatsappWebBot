## Supported Versions

Only the latest version is being supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email riky.isola@gmail.com instead.

Any security issues should be submitted directly to riky.isola@gmail.com
In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at riky.isola@gmail.com.
